# Contributing to Over-the-Wire

We're thrilled that you're interested in helping with the development of Over-the-Wire! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project and how to submit changes.

## Reporting Bugs or Requesting Features

If you spot a bug or want to request a new feature, please start by searching our [Issues](https://github.com/vaguue/over-the-wire/issues) to see if it has already been reported. If it hasn't, feel free to open a new issue. Please provide as much information as possible to help us understand the problem or the nature of the feature you're proposing.

## Contributing Code

Want to contribute code to fix a bug or add a new feature? Great! Here's how you can do it:

1. **Find an Issue**: Look through the [open issues](https://github.com/vaguue/over-the-wire/issues) for bugs or features that need help. If you're new to the project, look for issues tagged with "good first issue."

2. **Create an Issue**: If you want to add a feature or fix something that isn't yet reported, please open a new issue first. This lets us discuss the potential changes and how they fit into the project's direction.

3. **Fork & Clone**: Once you've identified an issue you'd like to tackle, fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.

4. **Make Your Changes**: Work on the changes as described in the issue. Make sure to keep your changes focused on resolving the issue or adding the feature discussed.

5. **Write Tests**: We use the native test runner of Node.js, so it's recommended to use Node.js v21.5.0 for development. All tests are located in the `test` folder. It's highly recommended to write tests for new features to ensure they work as expected and to help maintain the quality of the project.

6. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: Push your changes to your fork and then submit a pull request to the main repository. In your PR, include a description of the changes and reference the issue number (e.g., "Fixes #123").

## Future Plans for Bounties

We're considering implementing a bounty system for certain issues to reward contributors for their hard work. Stay tuned for more details on this initiative.
